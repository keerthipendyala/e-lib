Technology Used : MEAN stack 

Provides a platform for librarian to register for a library and add/remove books from its inventory. Students can register 
themselves to search for books, and check their availability in different libraries. They can then send a request to rent the book which 
can be accepted by any librarian of that library. Once the book is rented to the student, they can additionally return the book 
back to the library.
